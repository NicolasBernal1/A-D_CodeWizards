**Combinatorics Calculator**
Overview
The Combinatorics Calculator is a Python application developed by [Your Name] and [Contributor's Name] that allows users to perform various combinatorial calculations. The project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for calculating permutations, combinations, and variations with or without repetition.

**Features**
*Permutations:*
Calculate permutations with and without repetition.
*Combinations:*
Calculate combinations with and without repetition.
*Variations:*
Calculate variations with and without repetition.

**Implementation Details**
The application was developed using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. Below are the key components of the project:

**Functions:**

Implemented functions for calculating permutations, combinations, and variations with and without repetition.
Used factorial calculations as the basis for permutations and combinations.
Utilized user inputs to determine the type of operation to perform.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

Designed a simple and intuitive interface using Tkinter.
Incorporated input fields for users to provide necessary parameters for calculations.
Displayed the results of calculations in a clear and user-friendly manner.

**Usage**
To use the Combinatorics Calculator, follow these steps:

Run the main.py script.
Select the type of operation you want to perform (permutations, combinations, or variations).
Enter the required parameters based on the selected operation.
View the calculated result displayed on the screen.
